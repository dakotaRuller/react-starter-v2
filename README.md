### React Starter V2

This is a simple react application built from scratch to help anyone who wants to use it understand how to build a react application without using [creat-react-app link](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).

Everything you need to know about this application is explained once you run it. All you need to do to get that to happen is clone the repo and once its closed navigate to the directory using a terminal and run the command: `npm install` and once that has completed run the second command: `npm run start:dev`. Once thats done the application should open in a new tab in your browser and if by chance it does not do that open up a new tab in your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8080/.
